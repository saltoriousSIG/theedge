**The Gap Analysis -- Bridging The Divide**

![blog-3-img](/assets/img/blog-7-pic.png)

**First of all, let’s be clear on terminology. Needs assessment is not the same as the gap analysis, although they are sometimes used interchangeably.** Needs assessment is a systematic approach to identify and address knowledge and practice gaps among a target audience, incorporating a strategy to measure improvements after the educational intervention. The needs assessment process therefore incorporates the gap analysis, a systematic process to collect and interpret information and data in order to identify the difference between current practice and the optimal desired practice.

The gap analysis is a critical part of the needs assessment because it is central to formulating the proposed solution. The methods employed should be deliberate and structured, based on objective research not personal opinion, and should provide enough evidence to justify that a problem, gap or need exist that must be addressed. Be specific about the target population, supported, if available and relevant, by survey data, published research, anecdotal evidence and quote/s from a respected authority on the subject matter. Be sure to reference all facts and statements, including name and affiliation of the authority who provided a quote. It is important to keep the analysis focused. For example, identifying 1 or 2 key gaps and formulating well thought-through and achievable solution is better than attempting to address 5 or more different gaps with half-baked unachievable solutions. Similar to other sections of the needs assessment, keep the gap analysis concise, to build a compelling case.  

Since the purpose of the needs assessment is to identify and address a problem, when tasked with writing a needs assessment, I spend time reviewing the request to be sure that I fully understand the focus before embarking on the necessary research. Asking lots of questions up front is part of this process. This will help to target the gap analysis, and propose solutions that will address the gap/s identified. Generally, I break up the gap analysis into sections that is determined by the identified focus. Each section includes a concise gap statement, learning objective/s, and the desired outcome. Next, I provide a brief, and I mean brief referenced background to place the gap in context. This is followed by a discussion of the gap, supported with relevant data, surveys and/or quote/s from an authority on the subject matter. I only include information that is relevant and appropriate. At the end of each section I provide a very brief summary that includes the current practice/problem, and recommendation/s to close the gap.

The gap analysis can easily become a tedious read – lots of facts and figures. So be creative to make it an interesting and a visually pleasing read. For example, I have started a gap analysis with a hypothetical case that speaks to the problem/gaps I plan to address. I refer to the hypothetical case where appropriate throughout the gap analysis. I have plotted survey data as graphs, presented as a tables, or bulleted summary. I have bolded text for emphasis, or place a box around the quotes and shaded a different color. 

How many gaps statements and how long should the gap analysis be? This really depends on the scope, which should be determined during the initial planning phase, and certainly before you start writing. My general rule of thumb, for an educational activity that is 1 hour long, 3 gap statements, and the gap analysis section no more than 5 pages. I have not discussed here the nuts and bolts of conducting the gap analysis, or writing the gap statements – these are topics for another article. However there are several excellent books on needs assessments and conducting gap analysis. Some are included in my earlier article [Avoid Gobbledygook, Use Clarity, Structure and Flow](http://www.theedgemedicalwriting.com/blogs/2016/07/27/Avoid-Gobbledygook,-Use-Clarity,-Structure-and-Flow.html)
Google search will also pull up several articles on the topic.

Overall, the gap analysis is a critical section of the needs assessment. It must be supported with objective research, should be interesting to read, and must present a compelling case to address identified gap/s. I am a medical writer at The Edge Medical Writing.
