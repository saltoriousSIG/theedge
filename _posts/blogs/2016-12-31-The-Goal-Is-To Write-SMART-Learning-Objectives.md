The learning objective states the intended outcome after learners have participated in an activity. Learning objectives should not be written as a goal to be attained in the future, but rather as a statement of what learners are immediately expected to be able to do. 

Learning objectives must be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely), and directly linked to addressing the gaps identified in the gap analysis. Use good action verbs such as “explain,” “integrate”, “describe,” “discuss,” “assess,” “determine,” “analyze,” “differentiate”. Avoid non-action verbs such as “understand,” “know,” “learn.” Bloom’s Taxonomy of Measurable Verbs located here provides excellent action words for different stages of learning. Learning objectives should be written such that it address the question “What is measurable that learners will be able to do after their participation in the activity?” For example, “consistently integrate routine measurement of C-reactive protein during diagnostic evaluation of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis”. 
	
When writing learning objectives I pay particular attention to the gap statements (see The Gap Analysis -- Bridging The Divide) and craft the objectives around the statements. I also have close at hand Bloom’s and Fink’s taxonomy. In most cases, I strive for verbs that will measure competence and performance (i.e. verbs that fall under application, and problem solving), however, the focus of the needs assessment and the desired learning must be kept in mind. For example, verbs that focus on knowledge and comprehension may be more appropriate than those that focus on application if the education and intended outcome is for learners to grasp the fundamental concepts of how an investigational agent works or to be more knowledgeable about adverse effects associated with an agent. It can be tempting to write a long list of learning objectives, but keep SMART in mind. My general rule of thumb is that one gap statement should be supported by one learning objective.  

Overall, write SMART learning objectives that are linked to the gap statements. Be realistic, aim for no more than 3 learning objectives for a one-hour program.
