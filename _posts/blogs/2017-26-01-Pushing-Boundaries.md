2017 - Pushing Boundaries Beyond My Comfort Zone

January of every year is a month I equate with new beginnings, new goals and a fresh start. Every year in January, I set my goals for the subsequent 11 months, which typically include improving the quality of the services I provide to my clients, and addressing shortfalls based on outcome of survey I conduct with my clients. My goal setting also includes looking for ways to work better and smarter, but always staying within my comfort zone of expertise. I believe that doing so will keep me focused, and in so doing keep my expertise clearly defined. 

January 2017 however, challenged my approach to goal setting when a colleague, in the midst of exchange of pleasantries, casually dropped a bullet list of several projects that were lined up for 2017. What surprised me was the diversity of the projects, some completely unrelated to each other, and other, I was told, were ‘purely exploratory to lay the foundation for future projects’. My colleague went on to clarify that the diversity of the projects arose from ideas that emerged from previous projects, new opportunities that materialized during the course of delivering on projects, and the willingness to push boundaries and expertise beyond the comfort zone. The latter caught my attention as it is a full 180o to my goal setting approach. This conversation with my colleague turned on a light bulb. I realized that I am limited by the boundaries I set for myself, that I should be more embracing of new challenges that forces me out of my comfort zone, and in so doing widen my boundaries of ‘expertise’. 

My goal setting month is now behind me, and the next 11 months will be filled with exploration of new opportunities and an openness to push boundaries beyond my comfort zone. I will update on how I get on, in the coming months.
