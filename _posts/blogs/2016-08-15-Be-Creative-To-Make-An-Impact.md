**You are a medical writer assigned to write a needs assessment. To make your task easier, you have been provided with a plethora of information, including the therapeutic area of interest, target audience, and the program planned. The only thing you have not been provided with is the title.**

The title speaks volume, so to speak. The title is the first thing a reader or reviewer will see, and to some extent, predicts the scope of the content. The title can reward your hard work or send it to the shredder. 


In most cases, a good title takes time to develop, usually going through several iterations. With regards to a needs assessment, a good title must reflect the key educational need/s and the solution/s proposed. When crafting the title, several things must be considered, including the educational gap/s, the target audience/s, and the outcome desired. There is no single approach, wrong or right way to writing a title, and every writer will have their preferred style. Irrespective of the preferred approach, a good title must be sufficiently interesting and relevant, in order to capture attention and interest to read further.  

I am a medical writer, often charged with writing needs assessments and developing content for medical education. In most cases, I am not provided with a title for the needs assessment, or for the program or activity to be developed. Unfortunately, I am not among the lucky ones who can create the perfect title before the first sentence has been written. Like the executive summary (a topic for another blog), I finalize the title only when I’ve completed the writing task. I may start with a ‘working title’, primarily to keep me grounded and focused. As I develop the needs assessment or content, the title goes through various iterations, only to be finalized at the very end. The final iteration is written such that it captures the essence of the education that will be provided to the specific target audience/s. 

Writing good title for a needs assessment or content for medical education is both a science and an art, learned and perfected over time. Keep fair balance in mind, such that the title is not in any way suggestive of promotion. However, there is room for subtle creativity, but be cautious such that any entertainment value does not compromise seriousness of the message. A quick Google search for medical education activities will return several examples of excellent titles. The following are some examples: “Helping Patients Cope with Invisible Chronic Conditions – Explaining to Others What Can’t Be Seen”. I actually came across this title here (http://users.clas.ufl.edu/msscha/premedgen/cme_third.html). Another interesting title might be: “Lightening the Load on the problem: Addressing the Obesity Epidemic with New Treatment Advances”. 

Overall, creating a good title is a process that must capture the reader’s interest and attention, as well as the essence of the education planned. My approach involves starting with a ‘working title’ that is reviewed and revised as I write, then finalized at the very end. I am a medical writer at The Edge Medical Writing.
