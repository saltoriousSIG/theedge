**Anyone who works in the medical education field will, no doubt, have experience dealing with writing needs assessments or grant proposals. In addition to helping organizations secure funding for Continuing Medical Education (CME), needs assessments are critical to the development of content for CME programs.** Thanks to the high value that our society places on the advancement of medical education, even when the economy is in a slump, organizations will continue to invest in CME as long as educational programs can demonstrate value for money. 

This is not to say, however, that writing needs assessments or proposals is easy. In fact, it is a form of writing that can take years to master. Unless you or someone on your staff already has extensive experience in writing these documents, outsourcing to experienced writers who are entirely focused on writing for the medical communication industry, is a smart move.  Once you've identified a need for medical education that can addressed with funding, or narrowed down your options for potential grants, an experienced writer can take it from there. Such a writer can be found at The Edge Medical Writing, owned and operated by Helen Fosam, PhD. The Edge Medical Writing has the experience and medical industry knowledge necessary to craft balanced needs assessments and competitive grant proposals. Each writing assignment handle by The Edge Medical Writing is customized to a client’s specific needs and goals.

Dr. Fosam received her doctorate degree in physiology from Sheffield University in the United Kingdom, and spent several years in academia and the medical education industry as a faculty member, researcher, and research and development advisor. She has been published extensively in peer‑reviewed journals. As a medical writer, she has written on a variety of therapeutic areas for online and offline publications.
