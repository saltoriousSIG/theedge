Proposal Background Or Introduction -- Capture Attention With A Great Opening

![blog-3-img](assets/img/blog-6-pic.png)

**Do you like freestyle, as in freestyle dancing? The technique, organization, and finish is entirely up to you. Generally, the dancer with the best combination of moves to fit the theme, often attract the most attention.**

The background/introduction to a needs assessment or proposal has some similarity to freestyle dancing -- it’s up to the writer to select and organize the content to attract attention from the reader. While there are no specific rules to writing the background/introduction, it is important to keep in mind the purpose of this section, which is to demonstrate your knowledge, experience, and understanding of the subject matter. The goal is not to provide a long list of facts and statistics, but rather, concise and relevant facts that clearly articulate the problem and the need for solution. 

Writing the background/introduction is the point at which your thorough preparation pays off. As a reminder, read my earlier blog [Do These Three Things Before You Write -- 1. Preparation, 2. Preparation, 3. Preparation](http://www.theedgemedicalwriting.com/blogs/2016/07/27/Do-These-Three-Things-Before-You-Write.html) 

This section is not all about the literature, so be selective and use only the most relevant and up-to-date citations. Remember, your target reader probably knows this stuff inside out, so don’t use jargon, redundant phrases, or confusing language in the attempt to show how much you know. Your reader will, however, get excited if you provide information and facts they do not know, especially if it is relevant to the problem or challenge they want to solve. So sprinkle this section with relevant information you gathered from agency reports, guidelines, surveys and faculty quotes. But be cautious. I emphasize, only include information if it is relevant and support the point/s you are making.

When I write the background/introduction to a needs assessment or proposal, I ensure that it is well referenced. I often include a bulleted summary of the gaps, a statement about the proposed solution to address the gaps, and example/s of where similar solution has been successfully executed. I generally close the background/introduction by restating why the gaps identified is a problem which must be addressed with the solution proposed. 

How long should the background/introduction be? There is no strict rule on length because it depends on the scope. However, keep in mind that your target reader is very busy. Generally, if I keep the focus on information that is new to the reader, and include literature that serves to highlight challenges and support the gaps identified, then I generally do not exceed 1 page (12 font single space). Similar to the executive summary I finalize the background/introduction at the end because at this point, I have a clear idea of the focus, the gaps and proposed solution. Notice that between the executive summary ([see A Great First Impression Is Often A Winning Formula](http://www.theedgemedicalwriting.com/blogs/2016/09/15/A-Great-First-Impression-Is-Often-a-Winning-Formula.html)) and background/introduction, I have provided the reader with a snapshot of the entire needs assessment or proposal. So even if your target reader doesn’t read the rest of the document, they will have a good idea of your knowledge and capability to solve their problem, and may be sufficient to make a decision to work with you.

Overall, the background/introduction section should provide enough information to convince the reader that you are sufficiently knowledgeable about the subject matter, and able to address the problem or challenges identified. I came across these useful articles that summarizes effective and not so effective strategies for writing introductions, as well as great suggestions for opening statements.
