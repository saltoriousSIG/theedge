**Technical writing, such as scientific writing, content for medical education, as well as needs assessments and proposals, is not simply throwing relevant facts and figures onto a page, with the hope that the reader will figure out your key message.**  Like a well written novel, clarity, structure and flow are important to provide framework and focus, and to seamlessly connect your argument or present a compelling story. That story of course could be an explanation of how a new agent improves clinical outcomes, or a needs assessment to justify funding for physician education. Whatever your ‘story’, avoid gobbledygook -- the art of using jargon to complicate your writing and make it difficult to read and impossible understand. It is important to organize your writing such that the reader can easily follow your thought process, argument, and case. Consequently, your writing should follow a logical progression, organized such that it flows and makes a clear compelling read, from start to finish.

I write content for medical education and needs assessments for new grants. In the face of increasing competition for grants, and the need to deliver well written scientific content, I strive to ensure that my written work is well structured, and flows logically. Of course, this is not to say that it’s an easy process. If you are medical writer, develop content or write needs assessments, you may identify with the following adjectives that I sometimes (actually often) use to describe the process -- tedious, laborious, and sometimes exasperating -- but thoroughly satisfying. During one of my hunts for information, I came across a very useful publication, The Clincher Copywriting Formula workbook by Steve Slaunwhite, marketing consultant and author, available here. Slaunwhite provides the following simple formula for organize your writing so that it is structured, flows and produces result; 

1.	Problem/need
2.	Solution
3.	The evidence/clincher
4.	Call to action

Although Slaunwhite developed this approach for writing sales copy, I used this formula when I was writing a needs assessments, and it worked! I structured my needs assessment so that I identify the problem (the knowledge/clinical practice gaps), I present the proposed solution to close the gaps (the proposed activity/program and agenda) provide examples of previous programs that have worked and capability deliver (the clincher), with an invitation to take action and support the proposal. Try it. Of course, this structure is only one of several examples. Every writer has his or her own approach which is often determined by the specific project, but generally follows the same principle. Best Practices for Writing CME Needs Assessments by Ruwaida Vakil and Donald Harting is an excellent resource, and available here (http://www.amwa.org/Files/Education/PocketTrainings2015/BestPracticesforWritingCMENeedsAssessmentsPT.pdf). Another useful resource is the Guide to Conducting an Educational Needs Assessment: Beyond the Literature Review, and available here (https://www.janssentherapeutics-grants.com/sites/all/themes/ttg/assets/Needs%20Assessment%20Guide.pdf). I also found very useful A Practical Guide to Needs Assessment, 3rd Edition by Catherine M. Sleezer, Darlene Russ-Eft, and Kavita Gupta, you can find it here (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118457897.html).
 

Overall, a well written needs assessment, proposal or content for medical education, is one that is clear, well-structured and flows, such that ideas are cohesive, balanced, and does not leave the reader confused. Such approach separates a good writer from a mediocre or poor writer. I am a medical writer at The Edge Medical Writing.
