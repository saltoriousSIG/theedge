Some decisions, including grant applications, can be made on the strength of the executive summary. It’s a bit like making a great first impression. Remember, reviewers are very busy; they may have several similar proposals to read, and possibly have enough time to read only the first page. Therefore, the executive summary is potentially one of the most valuable sections of your proposal. 

In a nutshell, the executive summary should say it all. So what should, and should not be in the executive summary? Definitely, it is not simply a tweaked and condensed version of your entire proposal.  It should however, build a persuasive case focusing on solutions to a problem, such that it grabs attention, builds interest to learn more, and ultimately, is deserving of being approved. Remember, reviewers don’t have time to read through lengthy documents, so try to keep the executive summary to between half a page to one page long, unless specific instructions on length is provided. 

As regards to the best time in the process to write the executive summary, there is really no specific rule. Some like to write the executive summary first because it can help to organize thought and keep things focused, while others prefer to write it last because at this stage in the process, the problem is clear and proposed solution well defined. There are others who prefer a hybrid approach, that is, to start with a draft executive summary tweaked and revised along the way, then finalized once the needs assessment or proposal has been completed.

I’m in the group that prefers to write the executive summary at the very end. Being concise and to the point is the goal – I repeat, reviewers are very busy and do not have time for fluff or gobbledygook. Watch out for unnecessary repetition, that is, information in the executive summary need not be repeated elsewhere. So make every word count. Read my earlier blog Avoid Gobbledygook, Use Clarity, Structure and Flow [http://www.theedgemedicalwriting.com/blogs/2016/07/27/Avoid-Gobbledygook,-Use-Clarity,-Structure-and-Flow.html] Keep clarity, structure and flow in mind as you write the executive summary. As a reminder, here are the key points:
1.	State the problem/need – build excitement and interest about your needs assessment or proposal, focusing on your client’s problem and/or their challenge
2.	Propose solution – to the problem/challenge and that type of result that can be expected
3.	Provide the evidence/clincher – state some past successes, but this is not the time to bask in your glory, so keep it relevant, brief, and focused 
4.	Call to action – finish with explicit statement of your request. The goal is to encourage the reader to pick up the phone, email, or tweet, requesting to work with you. So be sure that your document includes your contact information.

Overall, the executive summary should be concise, persuasive and generally not more than one page long. This article [https://www.umuc.edu/writingcenter/writingresources/exec_summaries.cfm] from the University of Maryland lists important questions to ask when preparing to write an executive summary. The executive summary is your opportunity to put your best foot forward, so be sure to check and re-check for spelling, grammar and flow. I am a medical writer at The Edge Medical Writing.
