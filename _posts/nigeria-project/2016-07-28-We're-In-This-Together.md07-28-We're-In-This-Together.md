**My interest in the sciences, research, and medicine led me on a career path in medical education.  I have been on this path for the past 15 years.** At times I’ve found it challenging, but overall, very rewarding. In the past 5 years I have operated a successful medical writing consultancy. I enjoy my work, I am thrilled with my clients, and I believe my clients are happy with my work, judging from the repeat business. 
Then I caught the bug! This surprised me because I was convinced that I had immunity against the ‘applying your knowledge and skills to help humanity’. I have read countless articles about individuals who, at some point in their career, caught the bug. My condition first reared its ugly head in mid-2015. Although I had projects to keep me very busy, my mind kept wondering. I thought about the true value and impact of my work. I thought about how I could apply my skills in ways that could help others -- in a meaningful way. I even pondered whether my skills would be useful to anyone. You see, I am a medical writer. I essentially write content for continuing medical education, that is, material to help doctors keep up to date with new information in their field and to update their clinical skills. I also write a lot of proposals to help medical education companies to secure new grants for the excellent work they do in developing medical training programs. I guess when I became infected, I could have done, as countless others have done, engaged in a selfless act, as an effective antidote. I could have closed shop, taken myself to anyone of the several places in need of help, including places in the very town in which I live. I did not have to go far, or even do anything heroic, as countless others have done. But I enjoy what I do, and wanted to apply what I do best -- medical writing and medical education – to helping others.

My opportunity came, literally quite out of the blue. Being a consultant, I am exposed to a lot of information, some great, others not so great. On this particular occasion, I responded to a request from an individual based in Nigeria, let’s call him John. John seeking advice on organizing a medical education event in Nigeria. I provided my candid feedback freely, and gave myself a pat on the back for providing professional advice to someone in need.  I thought nothing further of it, and proceeded with my life and deadlines. A few months later, I was again approach by John, but this time he was looking for help to develop a fully-fledged sustainable medical education program in Nigeria. John narrated a personal story which basically concluded that many patients were dying from easily preventable diseases, and in some cases, was because many doctors in Nigeria do not keep up with new knowledge and skills after graduating from medical school, and therefore often did not have the skills to manage patients with easily preventable conditions.

Interesting, I thought. How can that be? Here in the US practice of medicine is a life-long journey of learning. Participating in continuing medical education (CME) is mandatory for all physicians who want to continue practicing their profession. Surely it must be the same in Nigeria. Really, can a doctor who graduated in Nigeria 5, 10 or 20 years ago expect knowledge and clinical practice to stay the same? I decided to do some research. I found that in 2011 the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) mandated that participation in continuing professional development (CPD), equivalent to CME, is required by all doctors for maintenance of their medical licensure. Only 5 years old, but it’s a start. Although I could not find any recent statistics on participation, I came across an article published in 2009, which estimated that less than 10% of doctors actually participate in CPD. Read it for yourself here. I shared this information with John, who then promptly connected me to a practicing doctor in Nigeria. The doctor told me that I didn’t need statistics to appreciate the challenges faced by doctors in Nigeria. He said that participation in CPD by Nigerian healthcare professionals is often hampered by financial constraint because it is typically out of pocket; even for those who can afford it, there is gross lack of access to the few CME opportunities available. In Fact, what the doctor said suggested to me that the 10% participation in CPD estimated in 2009 was probably a gross overestimate, especially when extrapolated to today. I dug deeper and found more statistics. I found that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Global Health Nigeria, malaria, lower respiratory tract infections, HIV, and diarrheal diseases are among the top 10 causes of deaths in Nigeria. Read about it here. Non-communicable diseases such as stroke and heart failure, together with complications from chronic kidney disease (CKD) was responsible for almost 32% of all the deaths, and that CKD alone accounted for between 8% and 10% of hospital admissions. Read about it here, here and here.  Furthermore, according to a World Health Organization report, Nigeria has the greatest number of people living with diabetes in Africa. Read about it here. In fact prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes are often misdiagnosed, undiagnosed and poorly managed. Many Nigerians are hypertensive and have chronic complications, but are unaware of their health status. While international aid provides much needed help to some of the worlds’ poorest people, good healthcare provided locally by knowledgeable and skilled healthcare professionals, can not only change lives, but can impact communities and the national. Teaching people to take care of their health (such as through medical education) is similar to the parable “give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.”

My bug has taken hold. I have found my calling. For the past 8 months, I have worked with John. Together, but largely credited to John’s initiative and contacts, we now have commitment from a formidable team of talent from the United States, India, and Nigeria to develop and teach CPD at no cost to Nigerian healthcare professionals. This team include consultants from the Kokilabh Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital who will provide teaching and the telemedicine service, consultants from Nigeria with knowledge of the challenges and local custom, a US-based academic institution, experienced fundraiser, and outcomes researcher. With my experience in planning, developing CME, and writing grants, I got down to work on grant applications, including approaching the Nigerian Federal Government for support and endorsement of our efforts. Grant writing can be an arduous, and sometimes unrewarding process. By Western standards, Nigeria is not a rich country, and diverting money to CPD programs so that doctors can attend for free is low on the priorities list, and few companies based in Nigeria are able to provide financial support for this initiative to the level needed. To make this happen, donations and international support are needed. We have on board an incredible team of talent, whose goal is to help a country address one of its several problems.  
We will continue our efforts to secure funding for our initial pilot CPD program in Nigeria. To learn more about our initiative, contact Helen Fosam (609 273 6019; hfosam@theedgemedicalwriting.com) or Renee Ebert (communityfundraising16@gmail.com).
