                                                <p>It is a pleasure to recommend Helen Fosam. As Scientific Director, Rheumatology at Medscape, she excelled in all areas—from her relationships with key thought leaders nation wide, to her ability to develop top notch programs for the web site—continuing medical education activities and others, alike. Helen also wrote needs assessments in a variety of therapeutic areas, volunteering to step in to help at a moment's notice, while still meeting all of the requirements of her own busy position. She is a consummate professional and a delightful individual.</p>

She is adept at understanding and synthesizing large amounts of clinical data and can translate these into relevant and impactful messages for clinicians and educators. In fact, I usually "reserve" complicated topics or therapeutic areas for Helen because I know she will handle them expertly.
