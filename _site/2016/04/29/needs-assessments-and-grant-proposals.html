        <p><strong>Anyone who works in the medical education field will no doubt have experience dealing with writing needs assessments and grant proposals. In addition to helping organizations secure funding for Continuing Medical Education (CME), needs assessments are also used to further the development of content for CME programs.</strong> Thanks to the high value that our society places on the advancement of medical education, you will find that there are companies and organizations willing to invest in medical education even during periods of economic downturns. 
This is not to say, however, that writing needs assessments and grants is easy – in fact, it’s a form of writing that can take years to master. Unless you or someone on your staff already has extensive experience with needs assessments and grant writing, outsourcing to experienced writers entirely focused on writing for the medical communication industry, is a smart move. 
Once you’ve narrowed down your options for potential grants that you or your organization can qualify for, an experienced writer, can take it from there. Such a writer can be found at The Edge Medical Writing, owned and operated by Dr. Helen Fosam. The Edge Medical Writing has the experience and medical industry knowledge necessary to craft competitive needs assessments and grant proposals from beginning to end. Each writing assignment that we handle is customized to the specific needs and goals of each client, and we promise to keep every client well informed on the progress of their writing orders.</p>

<p>Dr. Fosam was awarded a doctorate degree in physiology from Sheffield University in the United Kingdom and spent several years in the medical industry as a researcher, faculty member, and research and development advisor. She has been published extensively in peer‑reviewed journals and has been involved in medical education since 2003. As a writer, she is skilled in all phases of the writing and editing process and has written on a variety of therapeutic areas for online and offline publications. For a medical writer with a strong reputation for delivering on point and on budget, Dr. Helen Fosam and The Edge Medical Writing should be your number one choice.</p>

<p>Relying on over 15 years of professional writing and editing experience, The Edge Medical Writing specializes in helping members of the medical communication industry who require assistance with writing needs assessments and grant proposals, as well as developing content for continuing medical education. Our expert understanding of the medical industry and the needs assessment and grant writing process give us a powerful edge over the competition.</p>

<p>Being able to secure funding for continuing medical education is something that is too important to trust to a writer without actual medical industry experience. With verifiable credentials and past satisfied customers, The Edge Medical Writing is the writing agency you need on your side when you or your organization needs to secure funding for continuing medical education.</p>
